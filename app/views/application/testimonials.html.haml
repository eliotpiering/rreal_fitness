Bobby brings to his work a sense of purpose and determination that motivates even a somewhat less than enthusiastic athlete like myself. His background in medicine also adds a very valuable dimension to his overall outlook on regimen. Each session is carefully planned for me and my goals, and he always takes into account my personal bio-rhythms and other external issues that may effect my performance, focus and capacity. He is motivational, and always supportive, and he sincerely cares a great deal about his clients overall well-being. Without a doubt, he is the only trainer that could get me out of bed early 4 days a week - he is as inspiring as a great mug of coffee to wake up and greet the day, and I’m happy to recommend him unconditionally"}

He goes out of his way to provide a plan that caters to your goals with sensible instruction. He will work with you to feel as comfortable as possible, challenging you both mentally and in the gym. In no time, you’ll see yourself getting stronger, more motivated to hit the gym than the previous day and encouraged to show up for yourself in general. You’re getting a trainer, a hype man, and a friend all in one. In general, he’s an awesome guy and my favorite. Start work with him ASAP, or else you’ll regret it"}

My sessions with Bobby are informative, productive, and enjoyable.  He employs his considerable knowledge to provide me with challenging but doable work-outs that I can also use when I train on my own.  However, when I train with Bobby my results improve and I enjoy my time in the gym more.  He is astutely focused on me and my individual needs / challenges in each workout.  Bobby’s personality and energy are always positive and encouraging."}

Slayton, M.D., M.B.A.", title: "National Medical Director <br> Optum Behavioral Health", body: "I started my fitness journey with Bobby Villarreal in 2018 in the aftermath of a sports injury and desperately needing to get back in shape. <br><br> Now three years later, I am fully recovered and doing great.  I am impressed at how energizing the discipline and activity of weight training can be.  Bobby has been my inspiration as well as my coach. <br><br> He has an outstanding rapport with his clients, and tailors a program to “meet you where you are”  in terms of achieving your personal fitness goals."}

I work out with him 2-3 times a week and each session is vigorous, informative, results focused and fun!  Bobby is extremely knowledgeable about fitness and knows how to get a challenging work-out going for me.  He also knows when we may need to pivot or adjust/improvise due to possible physical limitations. <br><br> For years I thought my back completely limited me from doing squats.  Not anymore!  While I do have back issues, he was able to work with me to get me to be more flexible.  That has been such a game changer! <br><br> Bobby wants to make sure that I see results.  During our sessions he is completely focused on our session.  He is always happy and has tremendous energy and his personality just makes you want to workout more!"}
